\section{Resistors in Circuits}

\subsection{Resistors in Series}
I place 10 resistors, each with a resistance of $50 \Omega$, in series.  What is the total resistance of the system?\\* \\*

I place 10 resistors, each with a resistance of $50 \Omega$, in parallel.  What is the total resistance of the system?\\* \\*
$\Rightarrow 5 \Omega$

\subsection{Power Through a Resistor}
Two resistors ($10\Omega$ and $20\Omega$) are connected in series to a battery with voltage V = 10 V.  What is power dissipated in the $20\Omega$ resistor?\\* \\*
$\Rightarrow 2.2$ W

\subsection{Maximum Power}

\subsection{Temperature Dependence of a Resistor}
A copper wire has a temperature coefficient $\alpha = 3.93 \times 10^{-3} \Omega/K$ and a resistivity of $1.7 \times 10^{-8} \Omega m$ at 20$^\circ$C.  I extrude a piece of wire that is 1.5 m long with a radius of 1.3 mm.  What is the new resistivity of this wire if I heat it up to 100$^\circ$C?\\* \\*
$\Rightarrow 0.31 \Omega m$

\subsection{Bob's Plight}
Bob the college student is relaxing in his dorm.  Suddenly his mother calls and warns him that she is coming to visit and she will be there in 10 minutes.  Oh no!  His room is a mess!  He must hide his shame!  Without thinking, he leaps up and plugs in his 1000 W vacuum cleaner.  However, he forgot that he already has a 1000 W microwave running with some popcorn, a 600 W coffee maker bubbling away, and a 500 W plasma screen TV playing his favorite show (The Bachelor).  Will he be able to run all of these devices at once?  Or will the 20A fuse blow out, leaving him in the lurch?  You may assume all of these are 120V appliances.\\* \\*
$\Rightarrow$ The fuse will blow, and Bob will be sad...

\section{RC Circuits}
\vspace{10pt}

\subsection{Time Constant}
An RC circuit consists of a battery (V = 10V), a resistor (R = 12 $\Omega$), and a capacitor (C = 10 mF) all in series.  What is the time constant of the circuit? \\* \\*

\subsection{Charging an RC Circuit}
Suppose I have a simple RC circuit with a time constant of $\tau = 10$ s.  I charge the capacitor to 50\% of its maximum charge.  I then begin to discharge the capacitor.  About how long would it take the capacitor to discharge down to 10\% of its maximum charge?\\* \\*
$\Rightarrow$ 16 s

\subsection{Velocty Selector}
I cross a magnetic field with strength 1.7 T and an electric field with strength 2.8 N/C in order to create a velocity selector.  I fire a beam of particles, each with mass M = 2.1 kg, into the apparatus.  At what speed would you expect particles to pass through if they experience no deflection? \\* \\*

\subsection{Particles in a Magnetic Field}
A magnetic field is oriented into the page, and five particles are fired into it from the bottom.  Which particles are positively charged?  Which particles are negatively charged?  Which particles are neutral?  Of the charged particles, which ones have the largest mass?  Which ones have the smallest mass?

\begin{center}

\end{center}

$\Rightarrow$ B, C, and E are positively charged.  A is negatively charged.  D is neutral (no charge).  Since A seems to have the largest arc (just barely bigger than B), it has the largest mass.  Since C and E have the smallest arcs, they are tied for the smallest mass.
