\section{Mirrors}

\subsection{Plane Mirror}
Our good friend Bob the college student has a date with a beautiful girl tonight!  Sadly, he is a scruffy guy, so he needs to clean up before his date.  He wants to go out to buy a mirror so he can comb his hair properly, but he needs to save as much money as possible for dinner at a super fancy restaurant.  How tall of a mirror should Bob buy if he is 6 feet tall and he wants to see his entire body all at once?\\*\\*
$\Rightarrow$ 3 ft

\subsection{Mirror Problem \#1}
A converging mirror has a focal length of $|f|$ = 10 cm.  I place an object with a height of 6 cm, 30 cm in front of the mirror.  

\begin{itemize}
\item[A)] What is the final image distance?
\item[B)] What is the final image height?
\item[C)] Is it in front of the mirror or behind the mirror?  
\item[D)] Is it real or virtual?
\item[E)] Is it upright or inverted?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mirror Problem \#2}
A diverging mirror has a focal length of $|f|$ = 15 cm.  I place an object with a height of 6 cm, 10 cm in front of the mirror.  

\begin{itemize}
\item[A)] What is the final image distance?
\item[B)] What is the final image height?
\item[C)] Is it in front of the mirror or behind the mirror?  
\item[D)] Is it real or virtual?
\item[E)] Is it upright or inverted?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mirror Problem \#3}
A converging mirror has a focal length of $|f|$ = 40 cm.  I place an object with a height of 5 cm, 10 cm in front of the mirror.  

\begin{itemize}
\item[A)] What is the final image distance?
\item[B)] What is the final image height?
\item[C)] Is it in front of the mirror or behind the mirror?  
\item[D)] Is it real or virtual?
\item[E)] Is it upright or inverted?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mirror Problem \#4}
A diverging mirror has a focal length of $|f|$ = 20 cm.  I place an object with a height of 12 cm, 30 cm in front of the mirror.  

\begin{itemize}
\item What is the final image distance?
\item What is the final image height?
\item Is it in front of the mirror or behind the mirror?  
\item Is it real or virtual?
\item Is it upright or inverted?
\end{itemize}

\section{Interference Effects}

\subsection{Double Slit Experiment}
A double slit apparatus has a slit width d = 10 cm.  If I shine light with a wavelength of $\lambda$ = 15 cm on the slits, how many total bright fringes could I potentially see on the screen?\\*\\*
$\Rightarrow$ 1

\subsection{Single Slit Experiment}
A single slit apparatus with a slit width of 100 nm is 10 m from a screen.  If I shine light with wavelength $\lambda$ = 500 nm on the slit, at what position would we see the first minimum?\\*\\*
$\Rightarrow$ 50 m from the center
