\section{Mirrors}

\subsection{Plane Mirror}
Our good friend Bob the college student has a date with a beautiful girl tonight!  Sadly, he is a scruffy guy, so he needs to clean up before his date.  He wants to go out to buy a mirror so he can comb his hair properly, but he needs to save as much money as possible for dinner at a super fancy restaurant.  How tall of a mirror should Bob buy if he is 6 feet tall and he wants to see his entire body all at once?
$\Rightarrow$ 3 ft

\subsection{Mirror Problem \#1}
A converging mirror has a focal length of $|f|$ = 10 cm.  I place an object with a height of 6 cm, 30 cm in front of the mirror.

\section{Interference Effects}

\subsection{Double Slit Experiment}
Consider an electric dipole with charges +Q and -Q located at x = +1 m and x = -1 m respectively.  Calculate the net electric field at x = 0 m.

\subsection{Potential Energy of an Electric Dipole}
A place a dipole with dipole moment p = 10 Cm [+z] in an electric field E = 100 N/C [-x].  What is the potential energy of the dipole?

\subsection{Maximum Potential Energy of an Electric Dipole}
Suppose I put a polar object with dipole moment 2 Cm in a uniform electric field of magnitude 300 N/C.  What is the maximum possible value for the potential energy of the system?

\subsection{Multiple Choice}
Which of the following statements is NOT true?

\begin{itemize}
	\item[A)] If a perfect electric dipole is placed into a uniform electric field, the dipole can experience a net force.
	\item[B)] A perfect electric dipole consists of two equal and opposite point charges separated by a small distance.
	\item[C)] If a perfect electric dipole is placed into a non-uniform electric field, the dipole can experience a net force.
	\item[D)] If a perfect electric dipole is placed into a uniform electric field, the dipole can experience a net torque.
	\item[E)] If a perfect electric dipole is placed into a non-uniform electric field, the dipole can experience a net force.
