		<h2>Other Interests</h2>
		<p>When I am not sifting through equations and doing research, I do occasionally have time for some other hobbies!  Here are some of my favorite things to do in my free time:</p>
		
		<h3>Cooking</h3>

		<p>I love cooking all types of foods from all over the world, and I love cooking with people.  The kitchen is where I go to relax.  Recently, I have started to really focus on my cooking technique so I can start making food look as good as it tastes.</p>
		<h3>Gardening</h3>

		<p>Ok, so right now I do not have a garden.  I live in an apartment with no balcony, so space for plants is a little hard to come by.  However, I do love to garden whenever I get the chance.  I especially like growing herbs and vegetables since I can use the produce for my cooking.</p>
		<h3>Brewing</h3>

		<p>I only recently started learning about brewing, and it fascinates me. When you are making a batch of beer or mead, you are putting everything you learned in chemistry to practical use. Temperature, pH, boiling time, and exposure to oxygen are just a few things that affect the flavor of a brew aside from the ingredients that you use.</p>
		<h3>Reading</h3>

		<p>When I do get a chance to read for fun, I read everything from books to magazines to blogs.  I especially like non-fiction, fantasy, and science-fiction.  I also like to read through cookbooks and math or science textbooks.  Hey, somebody has to read them :)</p>
		<h3>Computers</h3>
		<img class="alignleft border" src="img/computer.png" height="70" width="70" alt="Epic Rig" />
		<p>Not so much the gaming aspect, but the systems themselves.  I like taking them apart, putting them back together, and playing with network systems.</p>
