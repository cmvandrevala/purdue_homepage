		<h2>Statement of Teaching Philosophy</h2>
			<p>My main goal in teaching is to show my students the beauty of physics and give them an appreciation of the structure of the universe.  I believe that in order to accomplish this goal, both my students and I have important responsibilities in the classroom.</p>
			<p>I believe that teachers who show curiosity and passion about what they teach motivate their students.  This passion must extend to all parts of the teaching process.  They must come to class on time and be prepared for the day.  They must present the course material in a clear and concise way, taking time to answer any questions that students have.  They must be willing and available to help students outside of class.  And they must take time to observe and analyze their classes in order to determine the progress and understanding of their students.  When I was a student, I would always feel annoyed when a professor seemed to blow off a class just because he felt like his time was wasted.  Thus, I strive to make sure that my students feel like I want to be there for them.</p>
			<p>I find that when I expect great things from my students, they become more motivated to learn.  Part of what makes a classroom effective is the passion and dedication of the students taking the class; I believe that my students are just as responsible for their education as I am.  In every single one of my classes, I have my students work in groups to solve quizzes and problems together.  Even when I take time to lecture and solve example problems at the board, I will make it a point to ask my students what they think the answer is and why.  I will never complete an example from start to finish without asking for the opinion of the class.  I also encourage my students to provide me with feedback throughout the semester rather than just at the end during course evaluations.  I need their input in order to create a better course.</p>
			<p>I think that a lot of people in this day and age miss the point of education.  They see it as something you need to get out of the way before you can get to your “real” job.  But I strive to show my students that this is not true.  Yes, education must prepare you for your future profession.  But at the same time, I want my students to realize that an education is not simply a list of skills that they will need to get by in their job.  Knowledge is worth pursuing because it is beautiful.  It adds a layer of understanding and meaning to our universe that we as human beings spend our lives searching for.  I do not pretend that this pursuit of knowledge is easy, but it is worth the struggle in the end.</p>
