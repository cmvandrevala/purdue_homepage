Purdue Wobsite
==============

These are the files for my personal website at Purdue University.  This is mainly an academic and teaching website, so it will constantly be updated with material for my classes.  


Content
-------

This website will include:

* Welcome and Homepage
* A Short Biography
* My Research Experience
* My Personal Interests
* My Teaching Philosophy
* Content for My Students
* Contact Information


Other Uses
----------

Since the university only gives us a small amount of memory with which to operate our website, I find it difficult to design and maintain a Rails app.  Thus, I will use this website to practice HTML5 and Javascript.
