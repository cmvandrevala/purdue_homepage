Purdue Wobsite
==============

These are the files for my personal website at Purdue University.  This is mainly an academic and teaching website, so it will constantly be updated with material for my classes.  


Content

This website will include:

*Welcome and Homepage
*My Teaching Philosophy


Other Uses
----------

Since the university only gives us a small amount of memory with which to operate our website, I find it difficult to design and maintain a Rails app.  Thus, I will use this website to practice HTML5 and Javascript.
