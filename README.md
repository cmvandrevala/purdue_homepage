I have been plagued by bugs and problems since the beginning of this work.  The main code works, but every time I try to modularize this code or clean it up, something goes wrong.  I have run into everything from slow page loading due to a lack of memory to PHP and JavaScript not rendering properly.  Even simple attempts to modularize this code with HTML include statements have failed.  At one point I could not even get a simple link to work inside the Course section.  Honestly, right now, I do not have the skills to fully understand why I am running into all of these problems.

So, I am going to publish this code even though it has not been cleaned up.  The website will work, but it will not be DRY.  In the future, as I learn more, maybe I can come back and figure out what keeps going wrong.
