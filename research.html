		<h2>My Research Interests</h2>		
		<p>Currenty, I am working in the Quantum Information and Quantum Computing <a href="http://www.chem.purdue.edu/kais/">group</a> under the direction of Dr. Sabre Kais and Dr. Yuli Lyanda-Geller.  My recent focus has been on quantum entanglement in quantum computing systems.  Specifically, how can one control the interactions between qubits in quantum computers.</p>
		<p><br /></p>
		<h2>Conferences</h2>
		<h4>5th Annual CSESC</h4>
		<p>West Lafayette, IN, USA; April 2013<br />
		Organized and attended the fifth annual Computational Science and Engineering Student Conference (CSESC) at Purdue University.  Presented a talk titled Quantum Computing 101.
		<h4>APS March Meeting</h4>
		<p>Baltimore, MD, USA; March 2013<br />
		Attended a series of seminars to learn about quantum computing and metamaterials
		<h4>Winter School 2012 - Quantum Information and Computation for Quantum Chemistry</h4>
		<p>Indian Wells, CA, USA; January 2012<br />
		Attended a workshop to learn about quantum simulation, coherence, entanglement, and methods for overcoming decoherence</p>

		<h4>215th American Astronomical Society Meeting</h4>
		<p>Washington D.C., USA; January 2010<br />
		Attended the meeting as a student and presented a poster on radio and X-ray research </p>
		<h4>19th Annual WSGC Conference</h4>
		<p>Milwaukee, WI, USA; August 2009<br />	
		Presented my undergraduate work in radio and X-ray astronomy</p>
		<h4>The Physics of Many Positrons</h4>
		<p>Varenna, Italy; July 2009<br />	
		Attended a two-week long conference at the Enrico Fermi School of Physics that covered the production and uses of concentrated beams of positrons</p>
		<p><br /></p>
		<h2>Undergraduate Research Experience</h2>
		<h4>Positron Beam</h4>
		<p>Marquette University; August 2009 – August 2010<br />
		Helped design, build, and test the first positron beam at Marquette University</p>
		<h4>Radio and X-Ray Astronomy</h4>
		<p>Marquette University; May 2008 – August 2009<br />
		Our major goal was to explore the possible evolutionary link between Type Ib/c and Type II supernovae (SNe).  Our group analyzed radio data from the Very Large Array and X-ray data from the Chandra, Swift, and Newton-XMM satellites under the guidance of Dr. Christopher Stockdale and Dr. Stefan Immler.</p>
		<h4>Validation at Boston Scientific Corporation</h4>
		<p>Spring and Fall 2007<br />
		I worked for two semesters as a co-op validation engineer  Our team performed tests on extruded plastics to see which industrial parameters would produce the strongest and safest tubes for medical devices</p>
